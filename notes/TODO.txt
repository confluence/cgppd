NOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLEANUP
* delete one of center and position
* delete Molecule::rotate
* make Molecule::rotateQ call Molecule::setRotation, etc.

ADD
* implement local translation
* implement crankshaft
* implement domain rotation

* local: update two bond lengths, three bond angles, four torsions
* crankshaft: update three bond angles and four torsions
* domain rotation about linker bead: update torsions and angles near edge bead; internal molecule E
* any linker change: recalculate centre - multiply, subtract, add, divide? main linker E, internal molecule E

FIX
* update simulation read / save to use DCD format

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP
* Split up main.cpp into definitions, functions and just the main function, so that it can be unit tested.
* Eliminate duplication between constructors which take an existing object as a parameter, and copy methods
* delete cruft marked for deletion
* difference between nonCrowderResidues and nonCrowderCount?

ADD
* Make angle terms, crankshaft moves optional; test efficiency / accuracy of including them
* Validation with a simple test case
* Is the caching stuff actually a good idea, or is it just overhead?
    * Write another version of the CPU bond calculation, which throws out the caching and calculates everything

TEST
Potential:
* test data
* !!! check performance of CPU NC E with doubles / floats
* unit test for kahan sums, repulsive crowding

LATER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Nice examples to go in paper

EVENTUALLY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIMISE

* init of gpu memory seems slower (underlying software change?)

* Now that there's more time, try doing stuff on GPU:
    * one molecule only (since only one molecule will have internal changes?)
    * but then we have to cache at the molecule level at least, so that potential comparison works
    * LJ/DH seems like a really good idea
    * Friedrichs, et al.have a kernel for bonded forces

CLEANUP
* Make CPU version compile -- now compiles, but not without CUDA libraries.  Need to fix makefile.

ADD
* Multiple GPUs?  Does that work?
