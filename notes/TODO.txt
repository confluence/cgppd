RIGHT NOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REFACTORING / TESTS
    * current homemade logging sucks. Replace with google-glog.
    * check if everything in the threads is still threadsafe. Have we actually run the code with multiple threads?
    * check if graph deepcopy works -- unit test the molecule copy function in general
        * check that really soon, to make sure that the bonded potential isn't slowly growing because the geometric features in the graph are being duplicated, or something. That would be bad.
    * potential weirdness in ubq/uim test
        * delta gets huge when UIM is flexible because of bonded potential
        * huge unbonded value (LJ?) for ubq when internal pairs are calculated
            * because non-adjacent residues within the rigid domain can be very close to each other.
            * we could ignore pairs within the same domain, but that would make the GPU implementation more difficult because it would have to know about rigid domains.
            * should we do it anyway? Instead of using moleculeId to determine internal calculation we could use segmentID.
            * Instead of moleculeID, send through a segment value which is a bitmask where flexible segments are negative powers of 2 and rigid segments are positive powers of two (a residue on a boundary can be in two segments at once). Then we can determine both whether two residues are in the same segment and whether that segment is flexible.
            * We should check adjacency either way; not just if the residues are in the same segment.
            * but will this screw with our alternate usages of the residue ID field? Probably not, but think about this carefully.
            * Argh! BUT we can only do this if we first check if they are not in the same molecule.
                * Can we repurpose another float for this? I don't think we can.
                * Can we adjust the segment mask to include a molecule ID?
            * in the CUDA code, there is a check for pos.w < 0.0f instead of pos.w == PADDER_IDENTIFIER. Fix that. The segment value should always be positive, though.
            * E_TiledKernelNC does not appear to have been updated with the new logic. So why is it producing the correct result?
            * Because we aren't testing the NC code in the flexible replica test. We should fix that.
    * Why are the async sample times different? Different grouping? Why are the intervals irregular? This may be working as intended; will need to compensate in unit test.
    * valgrind is really upset about a lot of the stl container stuff.

    * clean up crappy Potential internals now that there are unit tests
    * unit test for parsing various input files (amino acids, torsions, etc..)
    * clean up output files as much as possible
        * put a separate ABOUT file with compilation options in the directory instead of appending suffixes and putting crap in the PDB files
        * stop outputting rotation / translation (no longer relevant)
            * but only if compiled with flexible linkers?
    * take out the initial replica potential calculation -- that's what unit tests are for.

SIMULATIONS
* diubiquitin simulations -- once the segment code is fixed
    * DON'T FORGET to make a fake side-chain out of alanine

THESIS
* write foundations chapter
* keep writing

NOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MODEL CORRECTNESS
* potential is now much (?) bigger because of the bonded components -- that is likely to affect calculation of the bound state. Should it be this high? Are the units correct? Also including the potential from inside proteins should raise the total (right)?
    * analyse potential breakdown (from CPU-only version)
* Why is the LJ so huge for reference conformation 1 when internal potential is calculated? (assuming that two residues are really close together)
* Are any conversions required for the linker components?

CLEANUP / BUGFIX
* is it *actually* worth summing vector components separately? Probably not, and we don't do it everywhere anyway.
* remove unused code for e.g. old kernels and MC on the GPU
* use FLEXIBLE_LINKS flag in CUDA code; put back the old version if linkers are not enabled?
* fix chain processing
    * use chain names if they exist
    * fix old PDB files with chain id in the wrong place (WTF)
* remove printing of old cruft about translation/rotation
* 300k replica -- how is it found if there isn't one?!
* make sure all the non-crowders are actually loaded before all the crowders (don't rely on the input file to be correct)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIMISATION
* why not precalculate the LJ coefficients which are independent from r?
    * We could definitely at least store Eij instead of eij.
    * How much extra storage / memory transfer overhead would be required for 3 coefficients (3EijSigij, 2Eij and 2^(1/6)Sigij)?
    * Maybe do it and test it? float3 table instead of float.

TEST
* stuff that's disabled
    * Kahan sums -- sort of tested; no difference apparent

OPTIONS
* add possibility to individually enable / disable all the MC mutations?
    * would be useful to disable whole-molecule translation / rotation for individual molecule tests
    * and to disable flex moves if rigid domains should be static relative to each other

VALIDATION
* should we try crankshaft moves with more residues, and see if this improves the repulsive LJ results?

REFACTOR
* is it really necessary to use custom vector3f and vector3d types?
* is it really necessary to use size_t for iterators instead of int?
* Reorder methods and attributes, especially in header.  SETUP, MC MOVES, POTENTIAL CALCULATION
* MOLECULE: constructor / destructor
    * reserveResidueSpace not consistently used?
* AMINO ACIDS
    * clean up read from file

SIMULATIONS
* redo Ian's tail/no tail simulations with flexible tail; replicate post-processing used in original thesis

BENCHMARKING
* do simulations with linkers give better results than rigid simulations? (What does "better" mean?)
* how much overhead is caused by the flexible linkers (on the CPU and on the GPU)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LATER / MAYBE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLEANUP
* Remove dependence on cutil, which is not supposed to be used in production.
    * Need timers and a way to check CUDA errors?
    * Possibly read the cutil source code and reimplement these?

OPTIMISE / TEST
* is caching of internal potential subtotals important? Probably still useful for CPU LJ/DH code.

ADD
* Multiple GPUs?  Does that work?  It should just work.
