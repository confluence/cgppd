Potential:
* test data
* !!! check performance of CPU NC E with doubles / floats
* test kahan sums

MC moves:
* any linker change: main linker E, internal molecule E
* local linker bead translation -- update two bond lengths, three bond angles, four torsions
* crankshaft move -- update three bond angles and four torsions
* domain rotation about linker bead -- update torsions and angles near edge bead; internal molecule E

General:
* Make angle terms optional
    * also crankshaft moves
* test efficiency / accuracy of including them
* Validation with a simple test case
* Nice examples to go in paper
* Now that there's more time, try doing stuff on GPU:
    * one molecule only (since only one molecule will have internal changes?)
    * but then we have to cache at the molecule level at least, so that potential comparison works
    * LJ/DH seems like a really good idea
    * Friedrichs, et al.have a kernel for bonded forces
* Is the caching stuff actually a good idea, or is it just overhead?
    * Write another version of the CPU bond calculation, which throws out the caching and calculates everything
