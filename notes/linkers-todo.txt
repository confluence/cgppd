Setup:
* Use occupancy column to mark flexible linkers

Potential calculation:
* Limit bond, angle and torsion components to linker residues only?
* precalculate; store on links and residues -- in fact, can cache entire potential result!
** I guess everything can be stored on the link
** calculate once at the start
** set flags to determine if an update is required, in case of overlap after several local MC steps
** update each value once if necessary before potential calculation
** make potential calculations use cached values

* calculate standard potentials between linker beads?  Currently only done between molecules?

* Link to main potential calculation

MC moves:
* local linker bead translation -- update two bond lengths, three bond angles, four torsions
* crankshaft move -- update three bond angles and four torsions
* domain translation -- no local updates
* domain rotation about linker bead -- update torsions and angles near edge bead
