Read from PDB:
* Make custom PDB file for test case

Potential calculation:

WHAT IS NEEDED:
* LJ_component and DH_component methods on residue - DONE
* Consider doing the same for angle (residue) and bond and torsion (linker)? Pass in relevant parameters?
    * In fact, add a getter, and do everything including updating the cached value in the object
* similar getter on segment? change update_E to update_LJ and update_DH?
* Add cross-domain potential to molecule E
** Cache and only recalculate if necessary
* Add molecule E to main potential calculation



MC moves:
* any linker change: main linker E, internal molecule E
* local linker bead translation -- update two bond lengths, three bond angles, four torsions
* crankshaft move -- update three bond angles and four torsions
* domain translation -- no local updates
* domain rotation about linker bead -- update torsions and angles near edge bead; internal molecule E
