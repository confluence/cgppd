Read from PDB:
* Make custom PDB file for test case

Potential calculation:
WHAT IS NEEDED:
* Add linker potential calculations to main potential calculation
** iterate over domains / linkers, not residues -- how will this affect the GPU code?
** no calculation within rigid domain necessary
** calculate potential within linker as described in 2008 paper (on CPU)
MESSY SOLUTION; GIANT REWRITE:
* make Residues a 2D array (needed for main calculation)
** rigid domains include edge residues; linkers do not
** need to make Links a 2D array as well?
** array of ints to point to flexible segments within this array?
LESS MESSY:
* store start and end points of segments.
* When copying data to GPU, treat domains / segments as molecules

MC moves:
* local linker bead translation -- update two bond lengths, three bond angles, four torsions
* crankshaft move -- update three bond angles and four torsions
* domain translation -- no local updates
* domain rotation about linker bead -- update torsions and angles near edge bead
