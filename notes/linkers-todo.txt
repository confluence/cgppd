* Torsion angles?
* Use occupancy column to mark flexible linkers? Try to autodetect from secondary structure?

Potential calculation:
* Uncomment extra terms
* Link to main potential calculation

MC moves:
* local linker bead translation
* crankshaft move
* domain translation
* domain rotation about linker bead
