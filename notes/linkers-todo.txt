Setup:
* Use occupancy column to mark flexible linkers
* What do we do about multiple chains?
* Cache flexible linker indices?

Potential calculation:
* Limit bond, angle and torsion components to linker residues only?
* need torsion angle calculation
* verify that the four-term Etorsion calculation is applied *for each link*

* calculate standard potentials between linker beads?  Currently only done between molecules?
** in fact, probably need to do this for whole molecule?
** clarify > 3 residues apart thing
** re-read thesis

* Link to main potential calculation

MC moves:
* local linker bead translation -- update two bond lengths, three bond angles, four torsions
* crankshaft move -- update three bond angles and four torsions
* domain translation -- no local updates
* domain rotation about linker bead -- update torsions and angles near edge bead
