Read from PDB:
* Use occupancy column to mark flexible linkers
* Cache flexible linker indices?

Potential calculation:
* What do we do about multiple chains?  Need to consider boundary between chains if there are two adjacent linkers on different chains
* Limit bond, angle and torsion components to linker residues only
* Add linker potential calculations to main potential calculation

Change to main potential calculation:
** iterate over domains / linkers, not residues -- how will this affect the GPU code?
** no calculation within rigid domain necessary
** calculate potential within linker as described in 2008 paper (on CPU)

MC moves:
* local linker bead translation -- update two bond lengths, three bond angles, four torsions
* crankshaft move -- update three bond angles and four torsions
* domain translation -- no local updates
* domain rotation about linker bead -- update torsions and angles near edge bead
