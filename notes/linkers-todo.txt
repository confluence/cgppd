Potential calculation:

WHAT IS NEEDED:
* LJ_component and DH_component methods on residue - DONE
* Consider doing the same for angle (residue) and bond and torsion (linker)? Pass in relevant parameters?
    * In fact, add a getter, and do everything including updating the cached value in the object
    * pointers to neighbouring residues -- is this expensive?
* similar getter on segment? change update_E to update_LJ and update_DH?

* put kahan_sum, sum, distance somewhere accessible to replica and molecule

* Add molecule E to main potential calculation
    * E - DONE
    * E(a,b) - DONE
    * EonDevice - DONE
    * EonDeviceNC - DONE
    * What about async? MCSearchAcceptReject - DONE

MC moves:
* any linker change: main linker E, internal molecule E
* local linker bead translation -- update two bond lengths, three bond angles, four torsions
* crankshaft move -- update three bond angles and four torsions
* domain translation -- no local updates
* domain rotation about linker bead -- update torsions and angles near edge bead; internal molecule E
