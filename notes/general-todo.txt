REPLICA:

MAIN:

* Split up main.cpp into definitions, functions and just the main function, so that it can be unit tested.
* delete Replica::freeLJpotentials, Replica::setLJpotentials
* Remove audit
* difference between nonCrowderResidues and nonCrowderCount
* recordCrowders not used

UNIT TESTS:

MOLECULE:

* delete Molecule::rotate
* make Molecule::rotateQ call Molecule::setRotation ?

MISC:

* Eliminate duplication between constructors which take an existing object as a parameter, and copy methods
* Make CPU version compile -- fix flag mismatch.  Total mess.
