* replace 1.122462048309372981433533049679f with r0 definition

REPLICA:

* Duplication between phi function and E function -- use new method on residue (unit test!)
* Eliminate duplication between constructors which take an existing object as a parameter, and copy methods
* delete Replica::freeLJpotentials, Replica::setLJpotentials
* Remove audit
* difference between nonCrowderResidues and nonCrowderCount
* recordCrowders not used

MAIN:

* Split up main.cpp into definitions, functions and just the main function, so that it can be unit tested.

UNIT TESTS:

MOLECULE:

* Eliminate duplication between constructors which take an existing object as a parameter, and copy methods

* make Molecule::rotateQ call Molecule::setRotation ?
