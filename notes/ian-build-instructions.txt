Hi Adrianna

You can copy /home/ian/workspace/remcv2-20110222.tar.gz to where ever you want to work. Its a bit of a mess, for now, but the important bits in that archive are src/, data/ config/ (optional) obj/ output/ (empty it) and Makefile.

Alternatively, run it out of /home/ian/workspace/REMC.v2. eg ./REMCDockingGPU_OpenGL -r 1 -v -f config/UbUIM_400microM

There is a -h option to get all the switches and meanings.

Type make help and compile the open GL one. if you want to see stuff happening. Don't use -DEnableStreams, simulations run and make sense, but the stats they produce have a NaN somewhere in them some times, I never got around to fixing it.

Then use one of the configs with "-v -r 1" with the open gl binary and you should see some proteins  doing some stuff.

I've also used tau for profiling, you'll see the details in the makefile.

If you have any questions send them to me. I'll try and answer them asap.

Regards
Ian
