Questions:

* Temperature ranges and 300K replica

* Interpretation of RMSD distribution histogram (peaks and valleys), and how to pick cutoff
** Does the number of peaks correspond to the number of clusters?
** The further apart the peaks are, the further apart the clusters are?
** Complications:
*** distances between clusters are not the same -- more peaks / spikes
*** clusters are not the same shape -- more jagged, but still vaguely same shape. Picking cutoff more complicated?
** is all of this invalid because I'm using one dimension?

* Should we be using RMSD or DRMS for the clustering? Try calculating both?

* Differences between multiple runs -- do more runs to see if a pattern emerges. Not that bad if
* Possibility to use GPU cluster now, maybe? Probably not necessary; these do not take long. Just run ten copies, but find out about temperatures first.

Notes:

* close to 300K is OK
* try VMD clustering
* try running for longer
* ask Rob about the clustering parameters and histograms
* running larger polyalanine for longer probably necessary, esp. for repulsive LJ -- look at plot vs time; try running one of the medium-sized ones for longer

VMD:
* https://github.com/luisico/clustering
* load (with stride of 10)
* analysis -> align -- name CA; add all
* display -> reset view
* use plugin

* Lys-63: unattached tail moves around a lot, which may account for most of the blurring and for a lot of variation in the end-to-end length
* try representing the tail and the binding site using VDW, rest with points
** 73, 74, 75, 76, 77 -- 150, 151, 152, 153
