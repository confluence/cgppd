Questions:

* Temperature ranges and 300K replica
* Interpretation of RMSD distribution histogram (peaks and valleys), and how to pick cutoff
** Does the number of peaks correspond to the number of clusters?
** The further apart the peaks are, the further apart the clusters are?
* Differences between multiple runs -- do more runs to see if 
* Possibility to use GPU cluster now, maybe?
