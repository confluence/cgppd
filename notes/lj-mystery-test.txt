Old binary:

 -0.293705
 -1.056291
-10.277430
 -7.580391
  0.000104
 -5.562237
 -5.480217
-10.711965
 -9.900360
 -8.527747

First 3 are identical; then LJ starts to differ (but DH apparently still the same).

Ha! The old code broke on PDB files with no END. Original reference configuration files were missing ENDs from both PDB files?

With new PDB files:
