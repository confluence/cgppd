# CGPPD (Coarse-Grained Protein-Protein Docker)

This is code for performing fast coarse-grained protein-protein docking simulations on the CPU and GPU using Replica Exchange Monte Carlo. It is an extension of code written by Ian Tunbridge and described in [Tunbridge et al., 2010][1]. This extension was written for an MSc thesis, and will also be described in a forthcoming paper.

This code is a work in progress! It's very messy, needs a lot of cleanup and has lots of stupid commit messages.
